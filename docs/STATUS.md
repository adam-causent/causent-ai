# Causent — Build Status & Resume Guide

Last updated: 2026-07-09. Single source of truth for "where are we and how do I pick up."
Product: **"Did-It-Ship, Did-It-Work"** — connect GitHub, tie each shipped action to a
business metric, produce an honest causal readout on a scoped causal graph.

## TL;DR

The **full product loop is now closed end-to-end (locally, adversarially verified)** and is
**merged to `main`** (PR #1 `overnight/wire-up` → `main`, landed 2026-07-08). Seeded GitHub-PR
→ metric data flows through the **real** persistence bridge into `causal_edges` + append-only
`evidence_objects`, and the Next.js dashboard renders those engine-derived readouts **directly
from Supabase** (not seed), honoring the 45/45 confident-vs-gathering-data boundary. GitHub
ingestion, the honest AI-summary layer, and a deployable engine function are all built +
tested. The **live summary guardrail is now proven against the real model** (19/19 vs
`claude-opus-4-8`, 2026-07-04). **Everything else that remains is credentialed, not
code-blocked:** a GitHub token/OAuth (live ingestion) and Vercel creds (engine deploy). See
`docs/OVERNIGHT_REPORT_2.md` for the phase-by-phase evidence.

## What's built (all on `main`, verified against live evidence)

- **Causal engine** — `engine/causal/` (C1–C9): pure-numpy segmented-OLS Interrupted Time
  Series + a 7/14-day descriptive cross-check. **Honest by design:**
  - `FLOOR_CONFIDENT = 45` days/side — a confident `belief = 1.0` requires both sides ≥ 45
    daily points AND the CI excludes zero AND it survives BH-FDR AND the placebo didn't fire
    AND Durbin-Watson ≥ 1.3. Below the floor → `INSUFFICIENT_HISTORY` (belief withheld,
    "gathering data"). Strong autocorrelation → capped 0.5 (`AUTOCORRELATION`). FDR-demoted →
    0.5 (`FDR_DEMOTED`, auditable). Placebo fired → vetoed.
  - The causal method is **Interrupted Time Series** — deliberately **not** "CausalImpact"
    (Google's Bayesian structural method, which we do not use).
  - Verified by an AR(1) coverage gate: belief-1.0-on-noise ≤ 6%. scipy is a **test-only**
    oracle; shipped code is numpy-only (`t_ppf` matches scipy to ~1e-9).
- **Schema + RLS** — `supabase/migrations/` (4 files, 11 tables): org→project→workspace
  scope hierarchy, `memberships` (RBAC: owner/admin/member/viewer, inherits down), metrics +
  observations, actions (with `rationale_richtext`), clusters, nodes, `causal_edges`,
  append-only `evidence_objects`. RLS on every table via `has_scope_access()`. A live
  tenant-isolation gate proves user A can't read user B; 3 privilege-escalation holes were
  caught + fixed (metric_scope leak, admin→owner self-grant on INSERT/UPDATE).
- **Persistence bridge** — `engine/persistence/bridge.py`: server-side, RLS-scoped (engine
  stays stateless, no DB creds). Fetches metric+actions → `batch_readout` → appends evidence
  → materializes edges (direction/belief/reason from the authoritative ITS row) → cluster
  overlay. Live E2E gate + 3 integrity defects fixed and locked as regression guards.
- **CI** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: on every push/PR, spins up Supabase and runs the full
  suite (engine + RLS isolation + bridge E2E).

## How to run it

```bash
# DB-backed tests need the local Supabase stack (Docker must be running):
supabase start            # or: supabase db reset  (clean-slate migration apply)

# Full suite (1058 tests: engine + RLS isolation + bridge E2E):
cd engine && .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q

# Engine-only (no DB): the non-test_rls_/test_bridge_ files.
# Local DB URL used by the DB tests: postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres
```

Python env: `engine/.venv` (numpy shipped; scipy + psycopg are test-only dev deps in
`engine/requirements-dev.txt`).

## Key product boundary (don't lose this)

**A metric needs ~45 days of daily history on each side of a ship date before Causent makes
a confident causal claim.** Shorter → honest "descriptive + gathering data." This shapes the
first-partner ask (point it at a metric with ~3 months of daily history and a change that
shipped 45+ days ago) and the demo (pick such a metric). It is the "credible inconclusive"
the design was built around.

## Loop closed — as built (2026-07-04, branch `overnight/wire-up`)

The dashboard now renders **from Supabase** (materialized `causal_edges` + authoritative ITS
`evidence_objects`), not seed data. `lib/seed.ts` is retained only as a fallback behind
`CAUSENT_USE_SEED=1` (or on any DB-read error, so the app never white-screens). Verified: a
served `/impact` in DB mode matches an independent direct-SQL computation of the graph
cell-for-cell (Actions 10, Confident 4/50, Net +$249K, Gathering 15, Win 50%, per-action
lifts, all-dash sub-45-day May cohort), the 45/45 boundary is faithfully reflected, and the
service-role key does NOT reach the client bundle. New wiring:
- `engine/persistence/seed_demo.py` — idempotent tenant seed, materializes the graph through
  the **real** bridge over an **RLS-scoped** connection (`SET ROLE authenticated`). 10 actions
  (8 May PRs exercise gathering-data + 2 earlier landmark PRs make the confident path
  reachable, since no May-2025 action can reach 45 post-ship points before END_DATE 2025-05-23).
- `engine/persistence/run_demo.py` — bridge runner over the seeded project.
- `lib/supabase-server.ts` (server-only client, browser-import guard) + `lib/data/*` async
  getters + `lib/data/dashboard.ts` (`loadDashboardData()`, React-`cache` memoized, seed
  fallback). Impact cells show a signed number **only** for a confident directional edge;
  withheld/insufficient readouts collapse to "—" — no engine figure is ever fabricated.
- `lib/ingest/*` — fixture-tested, capped, idempotent GitHub → `actions` ingestion (pure core
  + live adapters + CLI, token-gated) with a `(scope_id, external_ref)` unique-index backstop.
- `lib/summary/*` — deterministic honest readout→prose generator + adversarial/regression eval
  harness (golden baseline) + invariant-clamped LLM polish seam (off by default).
- `api/engine.py` + `vercel.json` + root `requirements.txt` — deploy-ready (NOT deployed)
  Vercel Python function wrapping `batch_readout`, shared-secret + input caps, stateless.

### UI iteration (2026-07-09, from live review)

First dogfooding pass over the running app. All changes are seed-mode-visible and thread
through the same `lib/data` → component shapes (DB parity noted in `TODOS.md` P2):
- **Reports tab** (`app/(dashboard)/reports/`, `components/reports/*`) — a new fourth tab. A
  whole-project stakeholder report that rolls up objective + decisions + key metrics + impact
  analysis into one document (and is the summarization that feeds the decision graph). Saved
  reports list + `depth: "full" | "succinct"` (succinct = top movers only). Reuses the honest
  ITS figures + 45-day caveat so a report never overclaims. "Create Report" moved off the
  global header into this tab's "New Report" button.
- **North Star objective** (`components/actions/ObjectivePanel.tsx`) — a purpose document
  pinned above the Actions & Decisions list so the action log reads as bets against a stated
  goal. New `ProjectObjective` type + `seed.projectObjective`; `DashboardData.objective`
  (seed-only, DB path returns null pending an `objectives` row).
- **Aggregated-Impact restructure** (`components/impact/AggregatedImpact.tsx`) — dropped the
  Neutral/Negative tiles; the strip now leads with Metrics-Tracked + Improvement-Rate, then
  the top-4 metrics by magnitude of confident causal lift (from `impactByMetric`).
- **Honesty labels** — the Impact-by-Metric and Aggregated-Impact subtitles no longer claim a
  fabricated "Last 30 Days vs Prior 30 Days"; they say "net confident causal lift (ITS)".
- **Dev-mode flag** — `CAUSENT_USE_SEED=1` in `.env.local` pins the app to the deterministic
  seed dataset for visual iteration (skips the ~7s ECONNREFUSED hang when local Supabase/Docker
  is down). Comment it out to read from a running local Supabase.
- **Deferred** (`TODOS.md` P2): wire inert chrome buttons + cross-links (e.g. Impact actions
  table → the action in the Actions tab); DB-path parity for objective + reports + the trimmed
  aggregated-impact getter.

### Approved shell (2026-07-03, still current)

The approved shell (Next 16 + Tailwind v4) was visual-QA'd against the mockups on all three
tabs. Structure (as-built lives at repo root, NOT `/src`):
- `app/(dashboard)/{impact,data-workshop,actions}/page.tsx` + shared `layout.tsx` (persistent
  header + tab strip + Core Metrics drawer); `app/page.tsx` redirects `/` → `/impact`.
- `components/shell` (GlobalHeader, TabStrip, CoreMetricsDrawer, Logo), `components/charts`
  (pure SVG: LineTimeSeries with PR flags, ImpactBar diverging, Sparkline — zero chart deps),
  `components/{impact,data-workshop,actions}`, `components/ui` (Delta = colorblind-safe
  glyph+color+label, Panel, icons).
- `lib/{types,seed,format,derive}.ts`. Brand tokens + single light theme in `app/globals.css`.
- Real brand logo saved at `public/logo.svg` (stacked lockup); header uses a purpose-built
  horizontal lockup (`components/shell/Logo.tsx`).
- Note: `unstable_instant` (Next 16 route hint) was NOT used — it needs `cacheComponents`
  enabled and throws in Client Components. Revisit if enabling Cache Components.

## Next (priority order)

The four items above (UI↔Supabase, ingestion, engine deploy, summary layer) are now **BUILT
and verified locally** on `overnight/wire-up`. What remains:

0. ~~Merge `overnight/wire-up` → `main`~~ — **DONE** (PR #1, 2026-07-08). `main` is the loop.
1. **Provide the three live credentials** (none are code-blocked — see `OVERNIGHT_REPORT_2.md`):
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → run `RUN_LIVE_POLISH=1 node --test lib/summary/__tests__/live-polish.test.ts`.
   - GitHub token/OAuth → live ingestion via `lib/ingest/cli.ts` (per SEC3/T-TOK: per-connection
     token in Vault, not `GITHUB_TOKEN` stand-in).
   - Vercel creds → deploy `api/engine.py` per `api/DEPLOY.md` (+ set `CAUSENT_ENGINE_SECRET`).
2. **Per-request freshness** — dashboard routes are statically prerendered (DB read at build
   time). Add `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` (or revalidation) when live freshness is
   needed. Swap the demo service-role server client for a per-request `@supabase/ssr` RLS client
   (TODO in `lib/supabase-server.ts`) once real auth/session wiring lands.
3. **Auth** — multi-provider (email + Google + GitHub + SSO) via Supabase (SEC2).
4. **Design polish** — run `/plan-design-review` → `/design-review`; also fix the stale "Last 30
   Days vs Prior 30 Days" subtitle on the Impact-by-Metric panel (bars are net confident causal
   ITS lift across all history, not period-over-period). ImpactBar axis ticks, static account menu.
5. **Install the `server-only` npm package** so an errant client import of `lib/supabase-server.ts`
   fails at build time, not just at request time (defense-in-depth; no leak today).

## Open risks / TODO

- ~~CI's first cloud run not yet confirmed green~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-07-09 (PR #3).** The first
  cloud run was red, but not for the Python-version reason guessed here. Two causes, both fixed:
  (a) the schema relied on Supabase's *implicit* default privileges — `setup-cli@latest` in CI
  doesn't grant them to user-migration tables, so every RLS/bridge test hit `permission denied`;
  fixed by an explicit-GRANT migration (`20260709000000_grant_base_privileges.sql`). (b) two
  engine adversarial tests flipped on ~1e-14 float dust from zero-residual fits (nondeterministic
  across BLAS/numpy builds); fixed with a scale-relative dead-zone in the direction/placebo
  classifiers. CI now green (engine + RLS + bridge, 3m28s).
- `owner` role enforced server-side (no DB policy depends on it); hierarchy creation is
  service_role-only — see `supabase/SCHEMA_REPORT.md` residual risk.
- `nodes.semantic_ref` is polymorphic (no FK) — app-enforced integrity.
- The BEFORE_AFTER descriptive stat and the batch action-count cap exist; wire connectors
  (Postgres/BigQuery) later per the PRD (CSV-first).

## Document map

- `docs/designs/did-it-ship-did-it-work.md` — the PRD / v1 build plan (+ review report).
- `docs/designs/decision-graph.md` — the causal-graph data model + belief rules + roadmap (core asset).
- `docs/designs/security-and-auth.md` — auth, RBAC, RLS, threat model, secrets.
- `docs/ENGINEERING.md` — engineering standards (clean/atomic/component-tested/panel bar).
- `engine/OVERNIGHT_REPORT.md` — the engine build + honesty-fix + bridge build history.
- `supabase/SCHEMA_REPORT.md` — schema/RLS report + residual risk.

## Housekeeping

- OpenAI API key **rotated 2026-07-03** (old leaked key revoked; new key in `~/.gstack/openai.json`, 600, outside git).
- Local Supabase (Docker) may still be running; `supabase stop` to shut it down.
