# Causent v1 Schema + RLS Report

Branch: `feat/schema-rls` · Migrations: `20260703223627_v1_schema.sql`, `20260703223628_v1_rls.sql`

## Verdict

**Merge-ready.** All 11 tables ship with RLS enabled; the live tenant-isolation
gate passes (`gate_pass=true`, `tables_with_rls=11`, `leaks=[]`); the security
review returned `HOLES` with 3 findings, all fixed and covered by adversarial
tests.

## Tables shipped (11)

The decision graph plus its scope/RBAC spine. Every domain row carries
`scope_id -> workspaces` (the operating level).

| # | Table | Role |
|---|-------|------|
| 1 | `orgs` | Tenant root of the scope hierarchy |
| 2 | `projects` | `org -> project` |
| 3 | `workspaces` | `project -> workspace` (the operating scope) |
| 4 | `memberships` | `user × scope × role` — the RBAC grant table |
| 5 | `metrics` | Time-series definitions |
| 6 | `metric_observations` | Per-metric daily values (no `scope_id`; resolved via metric) |
| 7 | `clusters` | Collision-grouping overlay |
| 8 | `actions` | The shipped work (`github_pr`/`github_issue`/`manual`) |
| 9 | `nodes` | Materialized graph nodes (`METRIC`/`ACTION`/`CLUSTER`) |
| 10 | `causal_edges` | Directed belief edges between nodes |
| 11 | `evidence_objects` | Append-only audit trail + ML feedstock |

## RLS model

Isolation resolves through the `memberships` table over the scope hierarchy via
`SECURITY DEFINER` helpers (they read `memberships` bypassing RLS, so membership
policies do not recurse).

- **`has_scope_access(target_scope, min_role)`** — the helper the domain tables
  use. `scope_id` is always a `workspace_id`; it resolves the workspace's
  project + org, then defers to `has_scope_grant`.
- **`has_scope_grant(org, project, workspace, min_role)`** — the core
  downward-inheriting match. A membership grants its `role` at its most-specific
  non-NULL scope and **inherits downward**: a NULL `project_id`/`workspace_id`
  widens the grant (org-wide / project-wide). `org_id` is always set.
- **Roles** (total order via `role_rank`): `viewer(1) < member(2) < admin(3) < owner(4)`.
  - SELECT requires `viewer+`.
  - Data writes (metrics, observations, clusters, actions, nodes, edges,
    evidence) require `member+`.
  - Membership / scope-management writes require `admin+`.
  - `owner` is reserved for server-side org delete + billing.
  - `service_role` bypasses RLS for engine/server bootstrap; `anon` sees nothing
    (all policies are `to authenticated`).
- **Append-only evidence**: no UPDATE/DELETE policy, plus a table-level
  `REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE ... FROM authenticated, anon` as a second
  guard (TRUNCATE is not row-level, so RLS alone cannot stop it).

## Live isolation gate

Adversarial probes run against a seeded multi-tenant fixture
(`engine/tests/test_rls_isolation.py`, `test_rls_isolation_adversarial.py`):
sibling-workspace/project isolation, project-admin read isolation,
member/admin escalation attempts, cross-tenant UPDATE moves, anon visibility,
and `SECURITY DEFINER` reachability.

```
gate_pass          = true
tables_with_rls    = 11
leaks              = []
```

## Security review — verdict `HOLES` (3 found, 3 fixed)

1. **`metric_scope()` cross-tenant info leak.** The `SECURITY DEFINER` resolver
   returned the `workspace_id` of *any* `metric_id`, bypassing RLS — a
   foreign-tenant caller could resolve `metric_id -> workspace_id`.
   **Fixed:** the function now gates its own return on
   `has_scope_access(scope, 'viewer')`, returning NULL to callers without
   access (which makes the `metric_observations` policies default-deny for
   foreign metrics).
2. **admin→owner self-grant via `memberships` INSERT.** The INSERT policy
   checked only the `admin+` floor, letting an admin mint an `owner` grant
   above its own rank. **Fixed:** WITH CHECK now also requires
   `has_scope_grant(scope, role)` — the granter must already hold ≥ the granted
   role's rank.
3. **admin→owner self-upgrade via `memberships` UPDATE.** Same gap on the
   UPDATE path (an admin could bump its own row admin→owner). **Fixed:** the
   same granter-rank cap was added to the UPDATE WITH CHECK.

Each fix has a corresponding adversarial test asserting the escalation is now
blocked while legitimate within-rank grants still succeed.

## Residual risk (stated plainly)

- **`owner` is enforced outside RLS.** Owner-gated operations (org delete,
  billing) live server-side; no DB policy depends on the `owner` rank. If a
  future policy is written against `owner`, the membership rank-cap logic must
  be re-audited — an admin cannot *reach* owner via RLS, but the boundary is a
  convention the server layer must uphold.
- **Hierarchy creation is server-only.** `orgs`/`projects`/`workspaces` have no
  authenticated INSERT/DELETE policies (RLS default-deny); signup and org
  deletion flow through `service_role`. Any bug in that server path is outside
  the RLS guarantee.
- **`nodes.semantic_ref` is polymorphic with no FK.** It points at
  `metric_id | action_id | cluster_id` by convention only; referential
  integrity there is the application's responsibility.
- **The gate is a point-in-time result** against the seeded fixture. It must be
  re-run in CI on every migration touching policies or helpers to stay honest.
